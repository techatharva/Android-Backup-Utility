With Android Backup Utility, you can easily back-up your Android phone without waiting for hours. It's currently in a beta, and the final version should release soon.


# Note

This uses USB Debugging to work, so you will need to enable developer options on your Android and enable USB Debugging. This will break banking apps, so after you've completed the back-up make sure you turn off developer options.

## Tutorial
To enable developer options, go to your phones settings, about and tap the build number several times and there will be a popup telling you that developer options are on.
